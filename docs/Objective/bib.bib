	abstract = {Event-driven distributed systems have two important characteristics, which differentiate them from other system types: the existence of several software or hardware components that run simultaneously on different inter-networked nodes, and the use of events as the main vehicle to organize component intercommunication. Clearly, both attributes influence event-driven distributed architectures, which are discussed in this chapter. We start with presenting the event-driven software architecture, which describes various logical components and their roles in events generation, transmission, processing, and consumption. This is used in early phases of distributed event-driven systems’ development as a blueprint for the whole development process including concept, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. It also grounds important architectural concepts and highlights the challenges faced by event-driven distributed system developers. The core part of the chapter presents several system architectures, which capture the physical realization of event-driven distributed systems, more specifically the ways logical components are instantiated and placed on real machines. Important characteristics such as performance, efficient use of resources, fault tolerance, security, and others are strongly determined by the adopted system architecture and the technologies behind it. The most important research results are organized along five themes: complex event processing, Event-Driven Service Oriented Architecture (ED-SOA), Grid architecture, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, and Agent architecture. For each topic, we present previous work, describe the most recent achievements, highlight their advantages and limitations, and indicate future research trends in event-driven distributed system architectures.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICCW.2015.7247186},
	abstract = {Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) describes an ICT based environment that exposes personalized and context-aware intelligent services, thus creating an appropriate experience to the end user to support independent living and improvement of the everyday quality of life of both healthy elderly and disabled people. The social and economic impact of AAL systems have boosted the research activities that combined with the advantages of enabling technologies such as Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of Things (IoT) can greatly improve the performance and the efficiency of such systems. Sensors and actuators inside buildings can create an intelligent sensing environments that help gather realtime data for the patients, monitor their vital signs and identify abnormal situations that need medical attention. AAL applications might be life critical and therefore have very strict requirements for their performance with respect to the reliability of the devices, the ability of the system to gather data from heterogeneous devices, the timeliness of the data transfer and their trustworthiness. This work presents the functional architecture of SOrBet (Marie Curie IAPP project) that provides a framework for interconnecting efficiently smart devices, equipping them with intelligence that helps automating many of the everyday activities of the inhabitants. SOrBet is a paradigm shift of traditional AAL systems based on a hybrid architecture, including both distributed and centralized functionalities, extensible, self-organising, robust and secure, built on the concept of “reliability by design”, thus being capable of meeting the strict Quality of Service (QoS) requirements of demanding applications such as AAL.},

The main focus is on sensing, controlling the IoT infrastructure which enables the cloud clients to use a virtual sensing infrastructure using communication protocols. The following are some of the intelligent features that usually make building smart such as privacy and security, network architecture, health services, sensors for sensing, safety, and overall management in smart buildings. As we know, the Internet of Things (IoT) describes the ability to connect and control the appliances through the network in smart buildings. The development of sensing technology, control techniques, and IoT infrastructure give rise to a smart building more efficient. Therefore, the new and problematic innovation of smart buildings in the context of IoT is to a great extent and scattered.

However, this transition demands feasible and pragmatic solutions which not only aim at bringing the required change, but also frame the structure to accustom the work in technology for instrumental and worthwhile service.

We present and evaluate CONDE, a decentralized system for decision and control for Smart Building applications based on WSANs. Performed experiments shown that since data is processed within the network instead of transmitted to a central location, there is a gain in terms of the system response time and resource consumption. Therefore, CONDE improves the energy efficiency of both the monitored building and the WSAN infrastructure, when compared to centralized approaches. Moreover, it exploits integration of applications at the decision level to further improve the system efficiency.},
